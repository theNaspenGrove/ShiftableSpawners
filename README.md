# ShiftableSpawners
Instead of picking up spawners as an item, why not shift them one block at a time? Allow your players to move spawners around the world, but in a more balanced way by requiring them to build paths between where they found the spawner and it's destination! 

When a spawner is broken with a silk touch golden pickaxe, it will shift to one block away as long as the block is air and has a solid block below it. This means that in order to move a spawner you need to block every location where the spawner *could* go within a 1 block square radius around the spawner, think a 3x3 cube centered on the spawner, except for the one spot where you want it to go.
